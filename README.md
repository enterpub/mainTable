mainTable
=========

mainTable is a JQuery plugin which hepls showing large html tables.
***

The main advantage is it can handle **any structure** of html inside columns or rows. This means the original table may have any number of colspan or rowspan, contain complicated html inside columns (`<td>`). This is true for header (`<thead>`) and body (`<tbody>`)

***
So, what the plugin can do:

1. Freeze header

2. Freeze columns on the left. The quantity is configurable

3. Resize columns width. If left columns are freezed they are resizable too

4. Collapse\expand configurable number of rows. There is also ability to mark couple rows as one and when user clicks any of them the collapse\expand occures
